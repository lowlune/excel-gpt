# Excel GPT
A lightweight solution for using ChatGPT in Excel with only the OpenAI API.

# Description
As you may know, there is a lot of apps already available for using ChatGPT in Excel. However, they all come with some sort of subscription, often times with ridiculous pricing. That's why I looked for a simple solution, that I will be able to download locally (not from Microsoft Store), and use directly in Excel with only the OpenAI API, without additional costs. 

# How to use
Insert any prompt in cell in this format: =GPT("Say hi")
ChatGPT will automatically fill the cell with response

# How to install
coming soon
